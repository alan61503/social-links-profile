This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor Social Links Profile Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). The challenge involves creating a visually appealing and responsive profile card with social media links, allowing users to hover over or focus on interactive elements.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I gained deeper insights into:

- ✨ Styling buttons for hover/focus states using CSS.
- 🔧 Structuring a profile card layout with Flexbox.
- ♿ Enhancing accessibility for interactive elements.

Here's an example of a hover effect implemented for the buttons:

```css
button:hover {
  background-color: #00ff00; /* Neon green for hover state */
  color: #000; /* Black text color for contrast */
  transition: 0.3s ease-in-out; /* Smooth transition */
}
